# Univ Freshers' Week Timetable
This project aims to create an interactive freshers' week timetable web application for University College Oxford's 2025 freshers' week, using HTML for the structure, CSS for design, and JS for event handling. 

## Features
The code includes numerous interactive features, including:
- Day-by-day view of events
- Responsive top bar with a white tab to indicate which day is currently active
- Information about time of evenets, location, whether or not they are drinking events, and attendance
- Smooth Scrolling between days
- Icon Specification to allow users to add it to their phone screens
- Univ Colour Code + Font styling
- An interactive martlett button that shows users more information about the timetable

## Access
To access the timetable, please follow the link: (https://mariamelantably.github.io/univ-timetable/). 
To add it to your home screen, click the share icon (however it may look on that screen), click 'add to home screen' and rename it to 'Freshers' Week' or anything that you'd like. 

## Acknowledgements 
I'd like to thank the Univ JCR for giving me the ability to pursue this project and help the freshers out in the first week.
